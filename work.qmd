I have a strong foundation in **statistics, risk management, experimental design, and data science**. My experience spans academic research and industry applications, focusing on data-driven insights, financial modeling, and human behavior analysis.

## **Risk Management Internship**
**[Deloitte]** 
- Applied **statistical modeling techniques** to analyze financial risk and decision-making processes.  
- Conducted **data analysis** to identify patterns in financial risk exposure.  
- Utilized **R and Stata** to implement risk assessment models and generate reports.

**Shiseido** 
- Assisted in **risk assessment** and financial analysis, focusing on statistical modeling for business decision-making.  
- Conducted **data analysis** to evaluate risk factors affecting supply chain and financial operations.  
- Utilized **R and Stata** to build predictive models for identifying potential business risks.  
- Supported the **development of risk mitigation strategies** by leveraging data-driven insights.  


## **Academic Research**
### **The Effect of Reading Medium on Comprehension**  
- Investigated whether reading on **paper vs. screen** impacts comprehension.  
- Designed and conducted a **controlled experiment**, collecting data on reading performance.  
- Used **statistical analysis in Stata** to evaluate reading comprehension outcomes.  
- Findings contribute to understanding **cognitive processing differences** in digital vs. print reading.


### **Impact of Morning Exercise and Coffee on Problem-Solving Ability**  
- Conducted a factorial design experiment testing:  
  - **Exercise conditions:** Strength training, jogging, yoga, or no exercise.  
  - **Coffee intake:** 250 mL coffee, 60 mL espresso, or no coffee.  
  - **Outcome:** 20-minute problem-solving test performance.  
- Used **blocking by sex (male, female)** to control variability.  
- Analyzed interactions between **caffeine intake and exercise** on cognitive function.

## **Technical Skills**
- **Programming:** R, Stata, Python  
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** R Studio, Stata, ggplot2, pandas  
- **Statistical Modeling:** Regression, Monte Carlo methods, Experimental Design, ANOVA  

## **Future Directions**
I aim to leverage my expertise in **risk management, AI, and statistics** in future research and industry applications. I am currently exploring graduate programs in **AI, statistics, and risk modeling**, where I can further develop my skills in **predictive analytics and decision science**.
